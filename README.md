## Analysis of the case

The main question to anaylze is : does budget and school size affect the test results? 

Trend I:
Charter schools have better performance --> the top 5 schools (% passing math,reading &both and average grades) are charters.
For example,top charter schools have, on average, 6.7 score more points on math than the bottom five schools which are all district shools
( topfive ave math 83.6 vs 76.9 bottom five)
90% of chart school students pass both exams (vs. 53% from district schools)

Trend II:
District shools are bigger in size and have more budget. Roughly speaking, on average, district schools have 3X more budget vs charter schools ($3m vs 1 m)
and have 2.4X more students than charter schools.

However, we cannot make any inference since we will have to research the composition of the budget. In other words how does the budget impact the performance.
How does the size of the school impact the performance?
